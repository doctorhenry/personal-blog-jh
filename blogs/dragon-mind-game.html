A lot of our research still needs to be published (and publications are being written along with research grants). Fow now, here are some of the key concepts we use in our game for mental wellbeing and emotion regulation
        <ul>
            <li>Currated dialogue based on psychology experts and latest research </li>
            <li>Direct association with the character and the choices they make </li>
            <li>A narrative that challenges the way you may think of situations that trigger certain emotions </li>
        </ul>
                
        More information (and videos) will be made available as the research gets disseminated.
