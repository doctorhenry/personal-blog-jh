The focus was never on improving engagement, but if it was improved, it was considerd a happy bi-product.<br/><br/>
        The game revolves around actions taken in the physical world that get translated into game points. Consider how Pokemon Go used reacting with the real-world to progress in the game. In SEA, players (students) need to attend their classes and be punctual to get points. You also get points by completing a weekly questionnaire that is based on the standard questionnaire used in psychology to measure engagement. <br/><br/>

        Points are important in the experience, as they provided you with the following benefits:
        <ul>
            <li>In game currency that can be used to unlock new avatars </li>
            <li>Ranking in a leaderboard with all other players (students)</li>
        </ul>
        The game also sourced weather data (consider the University campus as the location) and traffic (if students drove in). This data was then aggregated to try and gain an insight into how environmental factors could interact with student engagement. Machine Learning is too strong of a word to describe what is happening here but it could easily be extended to include it.<br/><br/>
        Rounding off on the experience, to keep your avatar happy you needed to maintain engagement with your course and the game. Weekly notifications were sent out to try and maintain engagement with the game. <br/><br/>

    <div class="col-sm rounded game-content-blue makebold"><span class="first-letter">T</span>he Internet of Things enabled players to interact with the game without having to do anything else but be present in their timetabled room<br/><br/>
        The timetable data of each player (student) was stored in the system that accompanies the game. This allows SEA to know if you should be in a specific room at a specific time. <br/><br/>
        The accompanying system(s) also stored the Bluetooth address of the players' phones. The player did not need to have their Bluetooth enabled as the phone sends out intermitent pulses of information unless Bluetooth is fully turn off.<br/><br/>        
        The video explores how a web application, software that handles information from micro computers (Raspberry Pi), and micro computers all came together to create the data needed to progress in SEA.<br/><br/>
